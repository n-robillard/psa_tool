# GSA2PB : Implementation of Protein Block alphabet for the analysis of allosteric communication

## Description

This program is base o the GSA tools program, which is a tool for the analysis of the allosteric communication and functionnal local motion of proteins, with the use of a specific structural alphabet generated by GROMACS tool (4.0.x or 4.5.x). Here, we implement an other structural alphabet
