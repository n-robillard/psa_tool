    "GSA2PB have the main objetive to implement a analyse the allosteric communication, based on a structural alphabet, the Protein Blocks (PBs). The model of this program is GSA-tools, developped by Fraternalli *et al.* in 2013 (article), which analyze the trajectories of molecular dynamique by the use of a strucural alphabet. This approach was based on a succession of statistic analyze for predict the allosteric mouvment in a protein. However, GSA-tools use a old version of Gromacs, and was not totally useable.\n",

    "Here we implement the same statistic analyse but based on the PBs alphabet, which are provide by a free use software : PBxplore."
